/**
 * Fixes a bug in the BinaryDecoder that can cause OutOfMemoryError when deserializing corrupt data or deserializing with the incorrect
 * schema. Because this class uses the superclass constructor taking byte[], which is declared with package visiblilty,
 * it has to be in the package org.apache.avro.io.
 * <P />
 * The array size bug is triggered if you try to deserialize corrupt data or try to deserialize data with the wrong schema. When
 * this happens it can cause Avro to incorrectly read the array length and try to allocate a huge (basically a random 32 bit length)
 * array, causing major GC issues. This class protects against this behavior by performing a sanity check during array reads, making
 * sure we are not trying to create an array larger than our total input.
 * <P />
 * Because the byte[] based initialization methods are package private, this class must be in the package "org.apache.avro.io". We could
 * use a properly configured DecoderFactory to create the BinaryDecoder instead of relying on calling init ourselves, but this is not
 * possible since we have to extend BinaryDecoder. Alternatively we could copy the entire source of BinaryDecoder and create our
 * own decoder which does not extend BinaryDecoder. This latter alternative would be more difficult to maintain, and may require pulling
 * out additional package visibility helper classes and methods. We cannot use the public InputStream based constructor, as that
 * constructor creates large read-ahead buffers which is wasteful when reading from a byte[].
 *
